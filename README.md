# Netatmo to MQTT

This repository contains the simple python wrapper for the [Netatmo API](https://dev.netatmo.com/resources/technical/introduction) (subfolder [netatmo](./netatmo)) and a [sample script](netatmo2mqtt.py) to send the data to a mqtt broker (Mosquitto in my example). 
Intention is to have a smart home solution and integrate the Netatmo devices.
